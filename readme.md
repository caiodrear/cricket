classification models for t20 cricket and betfair odds streaming

## Description

two classification models to predict the winner of t20 matches (no ties). The first is a feature based model using aggregated cricket statistics about players in the two teams such as batting average, bowling economy etc.. The second is a player based model that uses the players presence in each team as a feature in addition to a few others such as how long ago and where the match took place. 

The project also features some code to stream odds live from betfair, making use of the excellent betfairlightweight package.
